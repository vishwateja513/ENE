# Student CRM with Coding Profiles Dashboard

A comprehensive React + TypeScript + Supabase application for managing student information and tracking coding performance across multiple platforms.

## üìã Overview

This application centralizes student data and provides unified analytics for coding performance across LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, GeeksforGeeks, and HackerRank platforms. It offers both student and admin interfaces with real-time data synchronization.

## üöÄ Features

### Student Features
- **Authentication**: Secure sign-up/login with Supabase Auth
- **Profile Management**: Complete student profile with batch and department info
- **Multi-Platform Integration**: Add coding profiles from 5 major platforms
- **Personal Dashboard**: Unified view of coding statistics and progress
- **Performance Analytics**: Interactive charts showing cross-platform performance
- **Leaderboard**: Compare rankings with peers across departments and batches

### Admin Features
- **Student Management**: View, edit, and manage all student records
- **Bulk Operations**: Refresh all profiles and export data
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Comprehensive insights into student engagement
- **Department/Batch Analytics**: Performance trends and distribution analysis
- **CSV Export**: Export student data for external analysis

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Edge Functions)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Deployment**: Vercel/Netlify (Frontend), Supabase (Backend)

## üìä Database Schema

### Core Tables
- `students`: Student profiles and authentication
- `coding_profiles`: Platform-specific profile links
- `coding_stats`: Performance metrics from each platform
- `unified_scores`: Normalized scoring across platforms

### Key Features
- Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection
- Automated triggers for timestamp updates
- Performance indexes for optimized queries
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity

## üîß Scoring Algorithm

The unified scoring system normalizes performance across platforms using weighted calculations:

- **LeetCode** (30%): Problem difficulty + acceptance rate + contests
- **Codeforces** (25%): Rating + contest participation + problems solved
- **CodeChef** (20%): Rating + contests + problem count
- **GeeksforGeeks** (15%): Problem-focused scoring with contest bonus
- **HackerRank** (10%): Balanced approach across all metrics

## üé® Design System

- **Colors**: Purple-blue gradient theme with semantic color ramps
- **Typography**: Consistent font weights and line spacing
- **Spacing**: 8px base spacing system
- **Components**: Glassmorphism effects with backdrop blur
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and micro-interactions
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design with breakpoint optimization

## üîê Security

- JWT-based authentication with Supabase
- Row Level Security policies for data access control
- Admin role separation for privileged operations
- Secure API key management through environment variables

## üì± Responsive Design

- **Mobile** (<768px): Optimized touch interface
- **Tablet** (768-1024px): Balanced layout with sidebars
- **Desktop** (>1024px): Full feature accessibility with multiple columns

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up Supabase project and configure environment variables
4. Run migrations to set up database schema
5. Start development server: `npm run dev`

## üîÑ Data Synchronization

The application uses Supabase Edge Functions to fetch real-time data from coding platforms:

- Automated profile refresh capabilities
- Manual sync options for individual profiles
- Bulk refresh for admin operations
- Rate limiting and error handling for API calls

## üìà Analytics & Reporting

- Real-time leaderboards with filtering options
- Department and batch-wise performance analysis
- Interactive charts for trend visualization
- CSV export functionality for external reporting
